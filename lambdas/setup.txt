The containers used to run the various code components need to be first imported into AWS.


Steps to get this working:

 0) install docker

 1) create an ECS container registry (or use the default one associated with the account). boto doesn't support
    creating a registry -- do it from the console.
  
    https://ca-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=ca-central-1#/repositories/create/new

    Your docker client will need to login to the registry:

       # run the command that docker will need to use
       $(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region ca-central-1)

       # note that the aws binary shipped with ubuntu is old and doesn't support `get-login`
       # use the one installed by pip. (see requirements). The first time, you'll have
       # to run `aws configure`


 2) inside that registry, create one ECS container repository per pipeline rule.

    Use docker CLI to push to the ECR repository of choice. (docker build, docker push, etc.)

      docker build -t test .

      # make the new local image an alias for a remote name
      docker tag test:latest 458136422280.dkr.ecr.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/test:latest

      # push the local image to its repository
      docker push 458136422280.dkr.ecr.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/test:latest

A job control lambda will divide the total work into jobs.


Each job executes in its own namespace:


Folder/key:

 input/    -- contains job description: relations with input files and parameters
              populated before job runs. command line entrypoint.

 output/   -- contains results of the computation.

 logs/     -- contains log files. stdout/stderr of job.

 meta/     -- contains flag files which mark completion or failure.
              timing information, and resource usage of the execution.
              this is filled in by the framework.
